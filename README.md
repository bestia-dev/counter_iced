My projects on GitHub are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## GUI for windows

A simple test program that creates a simple GUI for Windows with the crate `iced`.

This is an "retained mode" GUI and I will use that in my future works.
The resulting exe is heavier than with egui "immediate mode", but the exe looks like a proper GUI program. "Iced" is used to create the Cosmic Desktop of System76 and it looks nice.

## Cross compile to windows

On my machine I have Windows11 with WSL/Debian. I will cross compile to Windows, copy the exe file with `scp` and run it on Windows. 

I use `cargo-auto` for automation of the build process and to commit to GitHub. Just run `cargo auto` and follow the instructions. To work with GitHub it will need the Personal Access Token from <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.  

Copy the exe file from the container 'crustde' to win folder. Run in windows git-bash:

```bash
scp rustdevuser@crustde:/home/rustdevuser/rustprojects/counter_iced/target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/counter_iced.exe /c/Users/Luciano/rustprojects/counter_iced/

# then run in git-bash
cd ~/rustprojects/counter_iced
./counter_iced.exe
```

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
